### API Endpoints | Route Handlers:
Route Handlers are defined in a route.js|ts file inside the app directory. They are the equivalent of API Routes inside the pages directory but both will not work together.

* Route Handlers can be nested inside the app directory, similar to page.js and layout.js. But there cannot be a route.js file at the same route segment level as page.js.

* `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` are supported
```ts
// app/api/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  const res = await fetch('https://data.mongodb-api.com/...', {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'API-Key': process.env.DATA_API_KEY,
    },
  })
  const data = await res.json()
 
  return Response.json({ data })
}
```

### DB query, WaterFall vs parallel Request:
Database query can be done using RAW `SQL` or `noSQL` or Using a ORM like `Prisma`. DB query should be done from server component, not from client anyway.

Fetching data with Server Components don't require useEffect, useState or data fetching libraries and can be done directly using `async/await` and `Promise API`.

* WaterFall/Synchronous Request: Inside `async` function, each `await` call will block further code execution until finished.

* Parallel/Asynchronous Request: Inside `async` function, initiate all request inside of `Promise.all()` or `Promise.allSettled()`, which initiate all request at the same time, and return when all are finished.

```js
// Parallel Request Demo
export async function fetchCardData() {
  try {
    const invoiceCountPromise = sql`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices`;
    const customerCountPromise = sql`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers`;
    const invoiceStatusPromise = sql`SELECT
         SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'paid' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS "paid",
         SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'pending' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS "pending"
         FROM invoices`;
 
    const data = await Promise.all([
      invoiceCountPromise,
      customerCountPromise,
      invoiceStatusPromise,
    ]);
    // ...
  }
}
```
